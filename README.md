## About Igniter

Igniter is rapid and powerful framework. Major features are:

- It uses the most advance node managing method. All JS objects created as Igniter Elements are native DOM Nodes.
- Igniter based on Custom Elements Registry. It can be mixed with native, cause it **is** native.
- It is reactive. If you change Igniter Element, you actually change DOM.
- No Virtual DOM by default, no abstractions.
- You can use templates, mix generated HTML with JS without pain.

## Installation

Igniter is a frontend framework. You can use `./dist/igniter.dist.js` or minified `./dist/igniter.dist.min.js` files.

## Igniter in examples

### Construction

The core feature is that **Igniter element == DOM element**.
So, you can construct elements and attach them like any other element.

```
let { Div } = Igniter;
document.body.appendChild(new Div({}));
```

You can construct elements with some options.
The first option is `attr`, it should contain Object with element attributes.
For example:
```
let my_el = new Div({ attr: { "id": "my-super-app" } });
```
will be rendered as `<div id="my-super-app"></div>`
### Extending Igniter elements

Igniter elements can be wrapped in user's classes.

```
class MyDiv extends Igniter.Div {
  constructor(args) {
    super(args);
  }
}
new MyDiv(/* Some options */);
```

or

```
class MyDiv extends Igniter.Div {
  constructor() {
    super({/* Constant options */});
  }
}
new MyDiv();
```

### Shared storage

Shared storage is a build-in class attached to every Igniter element.
It is basically storage with `set()` and `get()` methods, but the data it stores is shared with children.
So, if you set/get some data on children it will be actually set/get on the root parent.
Shared storage can be accessed via `sharedStorage` field on Igniter elements.

## Reference

Igniter consists of build-in elements. They all can be created with some options.
The main concept here, that the first construction is an **initializing process** too.
So, the first construction **must** be done with options.
```
new Igniter.Div(options)

// The first call of any Igniter element must be done with options(even if it is an empty object).
// I recommend you always call elements with options.

```
Where `options` is an `Object` with fields:
  - custom *[optional]* - name of the custom element.
  It is helpful then you need to use classes on existing elements.
  For example, if you have an element `<my-button></my-button>` or `<button is="my-button"></button>`
  and JS:
  ```
  class MyButton extends Igniter.Button {
    constructor(args) {
      super(args);
      this.appendChild(new Text("text"));
    }
  }
  new MyButton({ custom: "my-button" }) // We are not using this element, we just want to initialize it
  ```
  And after running that script your button will become `<button is="my-button">Text</button>`.

  - attr *[optional]* - `Object` with attributes which will be attached in construction process.
  `new Igniter.Div({ attr: {id: "app"} })` will return `<div id="app"></div>`
